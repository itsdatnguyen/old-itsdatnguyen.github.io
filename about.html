                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Dat Nguyen. I've been programming since I was in grade 9. As of this date: (August 7, 2017) I am 20 years old.</p>
                <p>I am currently in college for software development.</p>
                <p>I have numerous side projects, all based around various technologies like Unreal Engine 4, Angular 2, Game Maker and Ionic 2. Its a fun hobby and I can show off to people.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="about projects">
                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>
                    I used Game Maker for a high school computer programming culminating assignment. I created <a href="https://github.com/itsdatnguyen/reds-adventure">Red's Adventure</a> which is a action/reflex based platforming game. 
                    I gave it a test drive on the classroom peers and they all thought it was impossible to beat. It seemed they really liked it. 
                    I got 95% for that assignment, and a cool github project to show off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After Game Maker, I decided that Unreal Engine 4 would be a great place to test out 3-D game development. For me, Unreal Engine 4 was a bit more better than Unity.
                    So I messed around with Unreal Engine 4 for over the course of 2 years, and created <a href="https://github.com/itsdatnguyen/stealth-game">Stealth Game</a> (I know, super generic name...) as a stealth gameplay demo.
                    A lot of its gameplay is borrowed from Splinter Cell: Conviction, which I based this game off of. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After taking several web development classes from college, I decided to invest in learning web development and create some websites. 
                    I refined my knowledge of Bootstrap and JQuery, and eventually decided to teach myself Angular 2. 
                    As a result, I was able to create <a href="https://itsdatnguyen.github.io/utility/">Utility</a>, which is an Angular 2 SPA that focuses on providing everyday utilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While in the middle of my coop at PHRI (Population Health Research Institute), I began working on my <a href="http://css-playground.com">CSS Playground</a> website.
                    Basically, CSS Playground is a website that makes it fun to learn CSS with playful sliders and select boxes. 
                    I've shown this project to a large amount of people, and I am consistently surprised by the amazing feedback I get.
                    CSS Playground is developed using the Vue javascript framework.
